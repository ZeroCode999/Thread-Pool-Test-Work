# Thread-Pool-Test-Work
 
Tasks:
1. Implement a class for a thread pool in which you can perform various tasks. If there are no free threads in the pool, then queue new tasks
2. Using this class, calculate the product of two matrices, dividing the problem into different threads (without unnecessary copying)
